# GP
A text-based daily planner

### About
GP is short for gameplan. Throughout college, I used a .txt file in Sublime text as my daily planner. This repo includes the file I wrote for custom syntax highlighting. 

### Goals
+ Keep track of assignments and scheduled events in the same place
+ Easily move notes and tasks from one day to the next
